Provides the data structures required for working with comparative maps.
</p>

<p>
A chromosome map (ChromoMap) holds zero or more features (Feature). These maps
can be kept together in related map sets (MapSet). A map can only ever exist
in a single map set. Lists of links between features (Link) are held together
in a link set (LinkSet). A link set also tracks the map sets that are involved
in all of its links.
</p>

<p>The objects that hold other objects (map sets holding maps, maps holding
features, and link sets holding links) are all iterable in 1.5 for loops using
their respective types.
