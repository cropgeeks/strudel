================================

features to implement -- general:

- online documentation
- Mac mouse control support
- dynamically determine suitable number of distance markers to display depending on the zoom level
- name panel with labels for the genomes
- show loci as filled rectangles rather than lines at higher zoom levels
- colour selector for user 
- separate data loading for left and right
- x-y plots of marker positions in both genomes (Oxford grid) for a given combination of chromosomes
- more flexible way of laying out genomes -- want to be able to show a genome more than once, and also want full functionality for all genomes regardless of whether they are classed as target or reference (do away with this distinction completely)


================================

QTL support:

- need option for reading in QTL data
- option to show homologies only that fall within a given QTL
- need option (dialog?) for user defining new QTL manually
- mouseover on QTL displays tool tip with info about the QTL

================================

Data:

- have annotation data for reference genome (e.g. rice) kept locally for fast access but perhaps include some kind of option for updating this if possible (manually? automatically?)


================================

Dave's list:

- colour chooser
- scrollbar for moving entire canvas up and down (not individual genomes)
- potentials:
	* include in raw data putative homologs e.g. for rice loci in barley and flag every entry in the data as mapped or putative; then display these in the mapviewer, perhaps in different colours based on the value of the flag
	* include all reference genome features and their annotation in the feature range results table (but not on the canvas)
	* have feature range results table sortable by at least position of target features and position of reference features but also chromosome
	* as a user defined option, have separate result tables for homologies with each reference genome and combine these in a tabbed pane
	* auto-arrange function for inverting all features on a chromosome in the same order as its homologs on another chromosome (or manual or combination of both?)



================================


Luke Ramsay's list (in descending order of priority):

- view full detail of reference genome at high/highest zoom level
- show centromere positions
- flip entire chromosomes and portions thereof
- highlight conflicts in conserved synteny, i.e. cases where the ordering of features differs between genomes
- selective highlighting of region of interest by a) Photoshop-style pan-and-zoom and b) pan and select at same zoom level to display only markers and labels in selected region
- filter link display by clicking
- highlight gaps in reference genome sequence (i.e. regions for which there is no physical map)
- move markers manually in GUI, at least in target genome
- parallel homology systems, based on e.g. blastn vs blastx, user chooses which one to see


================================

Jordi's list:
 

- different line colors for the best BLAST hit, second best hit, third best hit… 
- plot QTL profiles along the barley chromosomes
- select an interval on the rice / brachypodium side and get a list with all the genes located within the interval -- DONE

================================

List from genetics barley users' meeting:

Ability to flip chromosomes and parts of chromosomes/regions  - Luke.
Highlight links on mouseover – Linda.
Show annotation for both target and ref  - Linda.
Ability to move markers around. - Luke
Save project files including current state – Luke
Menu bar support for new/infrequent users – Robbie

================================

Xin & Andy's List:
+ Export feature lists
Screen found features by BLAST cutoff


================================

REFACTORING:

- handling of antialising needs to be streamlined
- look for unnecessary repaints
- link drawing algorithm -- review and improve if possible
- check whether any features are drawn offscreen (= unnecessarily)
- data loading and component initialisation code looks overly complicated -- review!

================================


BUGS to fix:
?(not resolved) range-start and range-end spinner controls look like they are too tall
- no multiple selection of Find results (maybe it's not meant to)
?(unresolved) if you CTRL-multiclick multiple chromsomes (down the middle) too fast, the AA gets confused and stays
  on all the times, even as new lines are being added
- performance with hundreds of lines is actually pretty bloody good (considering the circumstances)
- when maximising the window zoomed in chromosomes do not get scaled up fully (e.g. to fill the canvas again) and the application sometimes hangs
- drawing of visble regions in overview canvas is very inaccurate
- occasionally mouse clicks on chromosome seem to go unnoticed, e.g. for single click zooming
- in post data load stage there are unneccessary repaints when mosuing over chromosomes (although no features are showing)
- results filter in results panel does not update on global reset
- inverting chromosomes and then adding features to range explore results selects wrong region
