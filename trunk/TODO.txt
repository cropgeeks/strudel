================================

features to implement:

- chromosome numbers always visible
- colour selector for user 
- option to show homologies only that fall within a given QTL
- need option (dialog?) for user defining new QTL manually
- mouseover on QTL displays tool tip with info about the QTL
- separate data loading for left and right
- list panel on right showing links (names, e-values)
- links filter options below that on right

================================

Data:

- have annotation data for reference genome (e.g. rice) kept locally for fast access but perhaps include some kind of option for updating this if possible (manually? automatically?)
- need option for reading in QTL data

================================


Luke Ramsay's list (in descending order of priority):

- view full detail of reference genome at high/highest zoom level
- second reference genome (e.g. for Brachiopodium)
- show centromere positions
- flip entire chromosomes and portions thereof
- highlight conflicts in conserved synteny, i.e. cases where the ordering of features differs between genomes
- selective highlighting of region of interest by a) Photoshop-style pan-and-zoom and b) pan and select at same zoom level to display only markers and labels in selected region
- filter link display by clicking
- screen dumps
- highlight gaps in reference genome sequence (i.e. regions for which there is no physical map)
- move markers manually in GUI, at least in target genome
- parallel homology systems, based on e.g. blastn vs blastx, user chooses which one to see

================================

David's List:

- x-y plots of marker positions in both genomes (Oxford grid) for a given combination of chromosomes
-


================================

FIXES:

- dynamic antialiasing -- only have it switched on when there is no scrolling (even if user selected it as on)
- mouse controls need to be sorted out; clicking sometimes zooms instead
