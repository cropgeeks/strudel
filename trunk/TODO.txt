================================

features to implement -- general:

- name panel with labels for the genomes
- show loci as filled rectangles rather than lines at higher zoom levels
- colour selector for user 
- separate data loading for left and right
- x-y plots of marker positions in both genomes (Oxford grid) for a given combination of chromosomes

================================

QTL support:

- need option for reading in QTL data
- option to show homologies only that fall within a given QTL
- need option (dialog?) for user defining new QTL manually
- mouseover on QTL displays tool tip with info about the QTL

================================

Data:

- have annotation data for reference genome (e.g. rice) kept locally for fast access but perhaps include some kind of option for updating this if possible (manually? automatically?)


================================

Dave's list:

- scrollbar for moving entire canvas up and down (not individual genomes)
- potentials:
	* include in raw data putative homologs e.g. for rice loci in barley and flag every entry in the data as mapped or putative; then display these in the mapviewer, perhaps in different colours based on the value of the flag
	* include all reference genome features and their annotation in the feature range results table (but not on the canvas)
	* have feature range results table sortable by at least position of target features and position of reference features but also chromosome
	* as a user defined option, have separate result tables for homologies with each reference genome and combine these in a tabbed pane
	* auto-arrange function for inverting all features on a chromosome in the same order as its homologs on another chromosome (or manual or combination of both?)



================================


Luke Ramsay's list (in descending order of priority):

- view full detail of reference genome at high/highest zoom level
- show centromere positions
- flip entire chromosomes and portions thereof
- highlight conflicts in conserved synteny, i.e. cases where the ordering of features differs between genomes
- selective highlighting of region of interest by a) Photoshop-style pan-and-zoom and b) pan and select at same zoom level to display only markers and labels in selected region
- filter link display by clicking
- highlight gaps in reference genome sequence (i.e. regions for which there is no physical map)
- move markers manually in GUI, at least in target genome
- parallel homology systems, based on e.g. blastn vs blastx, user chooses which one to see


================================

Jordi's list:
 

- different line colors for the best BLAST hit, second best hit, third best hit… 

- plot QTL profiles along the barley chromosomes

- select an interval on the rice / brachypodium side and get a list with all the genes located within the interval -- DONE

================================

List from genetics barley users' meeting:

Ability to flip chromosomes and parts of chromosomes/regions  - Luke.
Highlight links on mouseover – Linda.
Show annotation for both target and ref  - Linda.
Ability to move markers around. - Luke
Save project files including current state – Luke
Menu bar support for new/infrequent users – Robbie

BUGS to fix:


+ cancel button (while importing data) has no effect
+ clicking the X button on the import dialog does close it, but the data still loads
+ mousewheel scrolling is too fast (or inconsistant, depending on zoom level)
+ "BLAST Cut-off:" label should be on the left-hand side of the slider
+ none of the dialogs have keyboard accelerators
?(not resolved) range-start and range-end spinner controls look like they are too tall
+ image export error message is "null" when exporting to write protected drive
+ Alt-click on a chromosome and watch the overview dialog. Don't move mouse and Alt-click again. And again...
  then try to drag mouse on overview dialog
+ dragging chromosomes up or down with the mouse does not move them at the same rate
  as the mouse
+ anti-aliasing is still enabling while changing the BLAST cut-off
+ the icons are inconsistant heights (select the drawing ones and look at the orange outlines)
+ the distance marker icon doesn't remember its state between sessions
?(cannot reproduce) "don't show this again" maximum-zoom level dialog continues to popup when checkbox is ticked (setting
  seems to be inversed)
- don't reset zoom level on Find until a Find is actually done
- Find dialog is a bit funny - you obviously don't new() it between uses, so it still has whatever the focus
  was last on when it reappears, which isn't always the text box, plus there's a flicker of what was in the
  text box then it disappears. Also, you should maybe leave the previous search there in case the user just wants
  to tweak it or remove a line or two
- no multiple selection of Find results (maybe it's not meant to)
- AA doesn't re-enable after a zoom reset
- Bradi**** etc homolog URLs are throwing an error message (in Studel)
- no obvious way to close the Find results without running another Find dialog
- explore range results can be off the visible display (mainly at the top) - is that expected?
- if you CTRL-multiclick multiple chromsomes (down the middle) too fast, the AA gets confused and stays
  on all the times, even as new lines are being added
- not sure if the correct expectation is seen when CTRL clicking reference chromosomes and using the two
  filter options - eg, ctrl click red 3 and left-blue 3 with all lines filter on - should all the lines between
  red dataset and blue dataset really be shown when you consider CTRL selected state? The filter toggles it
  but I thought it was meant to just be for on-screen or not

- performance with hundreds of lines is actually pretty bloody good (considering the circumstances)

-when maximising the window the chromosomes do not get scaled up and things sometimes generally hang then
