================================

features to implement -- general:

- name panel with labels for the genomes
- show loci as filled rectangles rather than lines at higher zoom levels
- colour selector for user 
- separate data loading for left and right
- x-y plots of marker positions in both genomes (Oxford grid) for a given combination of chromosomes

================================

QTL support:

- need option for reading in QTL data
- option to show homologies only that fall within a given QTL
- need option (dialog?) for user defining new QTL manually
- mouseover on QTL displays tool tip with info about the QTL

================================

Data:

- have annotation data for reference genome (e.g. rice) kept locally for fast access but perhaps include some kind of option for updating this if possible (manually? automatically?)


================================

Dave's list:

- scrollbar for moving entire canvas up and down (not individual genomes)


================================


Luke Ramsay's list (in descending order of priority):

- view full detail of reference genome at high/highest zoom level
- show centromere positions
- flip entire chromosomes and portions thereof
- highlight conflicts in conserved synteny, i.e. cases where the ordering of features differs between genomes
- selective highlighting of region of interest by a) Photoshop-style pan-and-zoom and b) pan and select at same zoom level to display only markers and labels in selected region
- filter link display by clicking
- highlight gaps in reference genome sequence (i.e. regions for which there is no physical map)
- move markers manually in GUI, at least in target genome
- parallel homology systems, based on e.g. blastn vs blastx, user chooses which one to see


================================

Jordi's list:
 

- different line colors for the best BLAST hit, second best hit, third best hit… 

- plot QTL profiles along the barley chromosomes

- select an interval on the rice / brachypodium side and get a list with all the genes located within the interval -- DONE

================================

List from genetics barley users' meeting:

Ability to flip chromosomes and parts of chromosomes/regions  - Luke.
Highlight links on mouseover – Linda.
Show annotation for both target and ref  - Linda.
Ability to move markers around. - Luke
Save project files including current state – Luke
Menu bar support for new/infrequent users – Robbie
