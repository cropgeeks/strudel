			Finding one or more features by their name:
			<a name="findFeatures"></a>
		</h4>

		<p>
			Click on the "Search Feature Table" button
			<img src="../images/find.png">
			on the toolbar. A table with all features in the dataset will be displayed at the bottom of the window (see
			<a href="#featureTable">table section below</a>). Enter a feature name or annotation search term and the features
			that don't match will be filtered out of the table as you type. You can also enter just a part of a feature name or
			annotation term -- wildcard characters are not required. This search is case-sensitive.

		<h4>
			Defining a range of interest by position:
			<a name="exploreRange"></a>
		</h4>

		<p>
			Click on the "Explore Range" button
			<img src="../images/range.png">
			on the toolbar. A dialog will appear where you can specify a genome, chromosome and start/end positions for a range
			you want to explore. Click the “Find” button in the dialog and a results table will appear at the bottom of the
			window (see
			<a href="#featureTable">table section below</a>).

		<!-- --------------------------------------------- -->

		<h4>
			Defining a range of interest with the mouse:
			<a name="rangeMouseSelection"></a>
		</h4>
		<p>
			A region for displaying all features can also be defined through the view itself. Hold down the Ctrl and Shift keys
			together (Mac: Shift + Cmd), then click and drag next to a chromosome along the region of interest. This will draw a selection
			rectangle. Selecting a region with the mouse will also highlight all the homologies originating in this region in real time. 
			Right-click and choose "Show annotation for features in range" from the context menu. This will display
			the results table (see
			<a href="#featureTable">table section below</a>).
		</p>
		<p>
			Press the ESC key to undo the selection and start over again.

		<h4>
			The feature/results table:
			<a name="featureTable"></a>
		</h4>

		<p>
			The table at the bottom of the Strudel canvas either displays the full set of features in the currently loaded
			dataset or a subset thereof, depending on how it was invoked (see above).
		</p>
		<p>
			Click one or more (Ctrl-click) rows in the table to display the features on the canvas. The results in
			the list can be filtered by genome by using the drop-down menu in the results table’s control panel at the bottom left. 
			One can also click the checkboxes to display labels and links for features if  a range was specified either through the dialog or with the mouse. 
			Sort the table by clicking on one header at a time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Clicking on the feature name hyperlinks will bring up a web browser with annotation information if a target URL for
			the genome in question was specified in the data file. The feature name is appended to the URL and a web browser
			will open with the corresponding page loaded.
		</p>
		<p>
			Results tables can be saved to a tab delimited text file by clicking the save
			<img src="../images/save.png">
			button on the toolbar, which opens a file save dialog.
