		<h4>
			Finding one or more features by their name:
			<a name="findFeatures"></a>
		</h4>
		Click on the find features button
		<img src="../images/find.png">
		on the toolbar. Enter one or more feature names (one per line) and click the “Find” button in the dialog. A table with
		features found will display at the bottom of the screen. Click rows in the table to display the features on the
		canvas.
		<p>
			Currently this feature only supports exact name matches.

		<h4>
			Discovering features in a given range on a chromosome:
			<a name="exploreRange"></a>
		</h4>
		Click on the range button
		<img src="../images/range.png">
		on the toolbar. A dialog will appear where you can specify a genome, chromosome and range end points for a range you
		want to explore. Click the “find” button in the dialog and a results table will appear at the bottom of the window.
		Click rows in the table to display the features on the canvas.
		<p>
			You can filter the results in the list by genome by using the drop-down menu in the results table’s control panel at
			the bottom left. You can also click the checkboxes to display labels and links for the features in the range.
			Clicking on the feature name hyperlinks will bring up a web browser with annotation information if a target URL was
			specified at in the load data dialog for the genome in question. The feature name is appended to the URL and a web
			browser will open with the corresponding page loaded. Sort the table by clicking on one header at a time.
		<p>
			Results tables from this procedure and the find features by name procedure can be saved to a tab delimited text file
			by clicking the save
			<img src="../images/save.png">
			button on the toolbar, which opens a file save dialog.
			<p>
			A region for disaplying all features can also be defined through the view itself. Hold down the Ctrl and Shift keys together, 
			then click and drag next to ta chromosome along the region of interest. This will draw a selection rectangle. Right-click and 
			choose "Show annotation for features in range" from the context menu. This will bring up a results table such as the one 
			 described above.

		<h4>
			Adding features from a user defined region into the results table:
			<a name="addFeatures"></a>
		</h4>
		Users can also insert additional features from a reference genome into the results table. This is done by holding down
		Ctrl and Shift together and left-clicking and dragging down next to a chromosome. This draws a slightly opaque box
		around the region of interest. Right-click within the selected area and select “Add features in range to results” from
		the context menu that appears. This will add all available features in the range (not just those with homologs) to the
		results table which can then be filtered, sorted and explored as required. Please note that there is currently no
		support for drawing all of the additional features on the canvas simultaneously – with very dense maps this would make
		the display all but unusable.
