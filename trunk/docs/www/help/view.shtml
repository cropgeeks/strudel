		<h4>
			Using the overview window:
			<a name="overview"></a>
		</h4>
		Click the overview button
		<img src="../images/overview.png">
		on the toolbar (this is a toggle button which shows/hides the overview). A separate window with a miniature version of
		the main canvas will appear. When one or more of the genomes are zoomed in, a slightly opaque red rectangle will be
		visible on top of the corresponding genome in the overview window and this can be moved up and down with the mouse to
		move the genome on the main canvas up and down. It also lets the user see at a glance which chromosome of the genome
		is currently showing on the main canvas.

		<!-- --------------------------------------------- -->
		<h4>
			Distance markers:
			<a name="distanceMarkers"></a>
		</h4>
		The distance markers button
		<img src="../images/distancemarkers.png">
		toggles distance markers on the chromosomes on and off (for all genomes). Please note that even when these are toggled
		to ‘on’ they will only show when a zoom level has been reached where a chromosome just fills the screen.

		<br>

		<!-- --------------------------------------------- -->
		<h4>
			Changing the shape of the homology links:
			<a name="linkShapes"></a>
		</h4>
		The links shape button
		<img src="../images/curves.png">
		lets the user toggle between curved, straight and angled link shapes (in ascending, then descending order).
		<br>
		<br>
		<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
		
		
		<!-- --------------------------------------------- -->
		<h4>
			Antialiased drawing style:
			<a name="antialias"></a>
		</h4>
		The antialias button
		<img src="../images/antialias.png">
		lets the user toggle between antialiased and plain drawing styles. This applies to links and text drawn. Antialiased drawing 
		produces smoother lines but comes with a significant performance overhead. Even when this button is selected, any 
		drawing operations requiring animation therefore use the plain drawing style, with another, antialiased redraw happening shortly after
		 the animation has stopped.

		<!-- --------------------------------------------- -->
		<h4>
			Filtering of links by visibility of features
			<a name="filterByVis"></a>
		</h4>
		To reduce the number of links shown users can choose to only view those links whose features are both visible on the
		canvas. This is controlled by the link filter button
		<img src="../images/linkfilter.png">
		on the toolbar which toggles this filter on and off.
		<br>
		<br>
		<a href="#top">Back to top</a>



		<!-- --------------------------------------------- -->
		<h4>
			Filtering homology links by BLAST e-value:
			<a name="filterByEvalue"></a>
		</h4>
		Using the BLAST cut-off spinner on the toolbar, users can set a threshold for the BLAST e-value for homologies above
		which they will not be shown. Links will be filtered synchronously as the spinner value is changed with the up and
		down arrows or by entering a new value and pressing Enter.

		<!-- --------------------------------------------- -->
		<h4>
			Manual override of feature and label display:
			<a name="featureLabelDisplay"></a>
		</h4>
		In order to control clutter on screen Strudel automatically controls when it displays features.
		This behaviour can be overridden by the user with the help of the show all markers button <img src="../images/showmarkers.png"> 
		which is specific to each genome and is found next to the zoom controls at the bottom of the main canvas. When selected, this button 
		forces the permanent display of features at all times. 
		<p>To force the continuous display of all feature labels, right click over a chromosome and select the "Show all labels" item 
		from the context menu. This toggles the display of all labels for this chromosome on and off. Only one chromosome per genome can 
		be selected for this at any one time.

		<h4>
			Exporting the current view as an image:
			<a name="exportView"></a>
		</h4>
		Click on the export image
		<img src="../images/exportimage.png">
		button on the toolbar and a save image dialog will appear. Choose a file name and location and click the Save button
		in the dialog.
		<br>
		<br>
		<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
		
		
		<!-- --------------------------------------------- -->
		<h4>
			Customising the colour schemes:
			<a name="customiseColours"></a>
		</h4>
		Click on the customise colours
		<img src="../images/customisecolours.png">
		button on the toolbar and the customise colours dialog will appear. You can swap between colour schemes by selecting a
		scheme from the combo box. On the left you can see a list of colours and on the right you can see a preview of the colour scheme. 
		To customise a colour scheme, double click on the colour for the element of the scheme you wish to change in the list and
		a colour chooser dialog will be displayed. Select your chosen colour, using the controls in one of the tabs, then press the OK
		button. You will now see the updated preview. Once you have finished customising a colour scheme, press the apply button to have
		the main view updated with the new colour scheme. Reset to defaults in the dialog sets a colour scheme back to its original colours.
		<p>The background colour scheme is normally a gradient between Background Gradient Start and Background Gradient End. To achieve a
		single colour background you should set both Background Gradient Start and Background Gradient End to the same colour.</p>
