		<h4>
			Using the overview window:
			<a name="overview"></a>
		</h4>
		Click the overview button
		<img src="../images/overview.png">
		on the toolbar (this is a toggle button which shows/hides the overview). A separate window with a miniature version of
		the main canvas will appear. When one or more of the genomes are zoomed in, a slightly opaque red rectangle will be
		visible on top of the corresponding genome in the overview window and this can be moved up and down with the mouse to
		move the genome on the main canvas up and down. It also lets the user see at a glance which chromosome of the genome
		is currently showing on the main canvas.

		<!-- --------------------------------------------- -->
		<h4>
			Distance markers:
			<a name="distanceMarkers"></a>
		</h4>
		The distance markers button
		<img src="../images/distancemarkers.png">
		toggles distance markers on the chromosomes on and off (for all genomes). Please note that even when these are toggled
		to ‘on’ they will only show when a zoom level has been reached where a chromosome just fills the screen.

		<h4>
			Changing the shape of the homology links:
			<a name="linkShapes"></a>
		</h4>
		The links shape button
		<img src="../images/curves.png">
		lets the user toggle between curved, straight and angled link shapes (in ascending, then descending order).
		<br>
		<a href="#top">Back to top</a>


		<!-- --------------------------------------------- -->
		<h4>
			Filtering of links by visibility of features
			<a name="filterByVis"></a>
		</h4>
		To reduce the number of links shown users can choose to only view those links whose features are both visible on the
		canvas. This is controlled by the link filter button
		<img src="../images/linkfilter.png">
		on the toolbar which toggles this filter on and off.
		<br>
		<a href="#top">Back to top</a>



		<!-- --------------------------------------------- -->
		<h4>
			Filtering homology links by BLAST e-value:
			<a name="filterByEvalue"></a>
		</h4>
		Using the BLAST cut-off spinner on the toolbar, users can set a threshold for the BLAST e-value for homologies above
		which they will not be shown. Links will be filtered synchronously as the spinner value is changed with the up and
		down arrows or by entering a new value and pressing Enter.

		<!-- --------------------------------------------- -->
		<h4>
			Manual override of feature and label display:
			<a name="featureLabelDisplay"></a>
		</h4>
		In order to control clutter on screen Strudel automatically controls when it displays features and feature labels.
		This behaviour can be overridden by the user with the help of controls that are specific to each genome. These are
		found next to the zoom controls at the bottom of the main canvas and, when selected, force the permanent display of
		features
		<img src="../images/showmarkers.png">
		and labels
		<img src="../images/showlabels.png">
		respectively.

		<h4>
			Exporting the current view as an image:
			<a name="exportView"></a>
		</h4>
		Click on the export image
		<img src="../images/exportimage.png">
		button on the toolbar and a save image dialog will appear. Choose a file name and location and click the Save button
		in the dialog.
