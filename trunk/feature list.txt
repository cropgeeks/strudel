Visible controls in control panel:

- reset zoom button left
- reset zoom button right
- check box "Show QTL homologies only"
- slider "BLAST e-value cut-off"
- background colour selector?

================================

User interaction:

zooming:
- zooming a la Photoshop -- click and drag panning over area (with the area being outlined at the same time) which then is zoomed in full screen height when user releases mouse
- selecting zoom icon and then single clicking on chromosome will center the clicked-on locus in the middle of the screen and zoom in by a predetermined amount (need to decide how much); applies to both genomes
- locus labels only display above a certain zoom factor

other:
- single click on chromosome in target genome shows all homologies with reference genome
- mouseover on a locus will display annotation information about the locus in text areas in the bottom panel (both genomes)
- option to show homologies only that fall within a given QTL
- user can set BLAST e-value cut-off which allows subsets of the links to be displayed that fall below a certain value (slider best here, needs to be continuous)
- need option (dialog?) for user defining new QTL manually
- mouseover on QTL displays tool tip with info about the QTL

================================

Data:
- have annotation data for reference genome (e.g. rice) kep locally for fast access but perhaps include some kind of option for updating this if possible (manually? automatically?)
- need option for reading in QTL data

================================

Other:
- display genome names 
- separate data loading for left and right
- no menu bar
- list panel on right showing links (names, e-values)
- links filter options below that on right

========================================

class design:

application class (MapViewer)
main frame (WinMain)
main canvas (panel)
drawable objects become classes (chromosome, genome, etc) -- link to data objects
panels for overviews, control panel, status bar, annotation info, zoom control
[notation: e.g. GLine for graphical rep of Line class]
mouse handling stuff
QTL track (panel)
