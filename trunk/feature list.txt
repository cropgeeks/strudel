================================

zooming:

- zooming a la Photoshop -- click and drag panning over area (with the area being outlined at the same time) which then is zoomed in full screen height when user releases mouse

================================

other:

- option to show homologies only that fall within a given QTL
- user can set BLAST e-value cut-off which allows subsets of the links to be displayed that fall below a certain value (slider best here, needs to be continuous)
- need option (dialog?) for user defining new QTL manually
- mouseover on QTL displays tool tip with info about the QTL
- separate data loading for left and right
- list panel on right showing links (names, e-values)
- links filter options below that on right

================================

Data:

- have annotation data for reference genome (e.g. rice) kep locally for fast access but perhaps include some kind of option for updating this if possible (manually? automatically?)
- need option for reading in QTL data
